## Non-Bundled Plugins

Unlike [themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes), there are no restrictions for integrating your plugin into the zsh bundle. However, the purpose of creating this page is to address a common concern: uncertainty about whether your plugin might inadvertently cause harm, potentially disrupting the system or its functionalities.

**Installation**: Clear instructions are crucial and should adhere to these [guidelines](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-plugins).

### GIT

- [Auto Status](https://gist.github.com/oshybystyi/475ee7768efc03727f21)

  If you found yourself constantly typing `git status` after bunch of commands like
  `git commit` and you want to avoid that, then this plugin is for you. This plugin is a nice addition to **git_prompt_status**.

- [Branch](https://github.com/cpwillis/omz-git-branch)

  This plugin visually formats the current git branch name or commit hash, considering customizable variables like hiding status, maximum branch length, prefix, and suffix trimming, with an option to display git status. For example;

  ```
  abc-custom-feature-xyz-12345678       -->  custom-fe...12345678
  user123/repo-9876/fix-bug-in-feature  -->  9876/fix...-feature
  ```

- [Custom Git](https://github.com/davidde/git)

  A small, tidy, lightweight notes app that creates a daily text file and timestamps every line of added text

- [Mingit](https://github.com/evansendra/mingit/tree/master/mingit-ohmyzsh)

  An alternative to the default ohmyzsh git plugin.

  ```
  g a .                      // git add .
  g b other-branch           // git branch other-branch
  g b which                  // git branch --show-current (note this assumes git version >= 2.22)
  g c -m "made some changes" // git commit -m "made some changes"
  g co master                // git checkout master
  g d                        // git diff
  g f                        // git fetch
  g i                        // git init

  g s                        // git status

  // autocompletions
  $ g co <TAB><TAB>

	Synchronize your [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) window names with active ssh sessions. This plugin dynamically updates the tmux window name to reflect the remote hosts of active ssh sessions in the same window. It also restores the original window name when all ssh sessions are closed.

### UNORGANISED

- [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/cpwillis)

  I'm a template... when adding a new plugin, please follow my structure or copypasta me. Organise your addition into the existing sub-headings **alphabetically** (or make a new one). If you're unsure, just add it below and someone will organise it for you. :)
