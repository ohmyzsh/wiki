Oh My Zsh comes bundled with plugins, which allow you to take advantage of functionality of many sorts to your shell just by enabling them. They are
each documented in the README file in their respective `plugins/` folder.

Enable a plugin by adding its name to the `plugins` array in your `.zshrc` file (found in the `$HOME`
directory). For example, this enables the `rails`, `git` and `ruby` plugins, **in that order**:

```shell
plugins=(rails git ruby)
```

**_NOTE: elements in zsh arrays are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines...). DO NOT use commas._**

## Plugins

<!--
  Update via scripts/list-plugins.sh (requires local installation of Oh My Zsh).
  These plugins' descriptions are taken manually as the script is not smart enough to get them: wd, zsh-navigation-tools.
  Also the automatic lowercasing does not account for names (Chuck Norris), which are harder to detect than acronyms.
